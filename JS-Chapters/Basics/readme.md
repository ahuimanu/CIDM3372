# Covering some basic skills with examples

These basics roughly follow the [W3Schools resource on JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).

## basics_one

### where does JavaScript go?
In the beginning, [JavaScript was designed to work within a browser](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp).

We would call upon JavaScript with the 
```html 
<script></script>
```
element

We can do this by either putting JavaScript (JS) code directly into the `script` element or by referring to an external file.

## basics_two

At the most basic level, a programming language exists to read, store, transform, and write data - JavaScript is no different.

## basics_three

JavaScript grew up as a means of manipulating the [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction).

## basics_four

The data that we store can be broadly classified as:
* [numbers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type)
* [strings and characters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type)
* [booleans yes/no - true/false](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#boolean_type)
* [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#objects)
* [data structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#indexed_collections_arrays_and_typed_arrays)

## basics_five

We can both create our own methods/functions and also use those that come built-in to JavaScript.

## basics_six

Objects allow us to create a container to keep related data and functions together in a single package.

## basics_seven

Another major feature of JavaScript is its ability to detect browser and DOM events.

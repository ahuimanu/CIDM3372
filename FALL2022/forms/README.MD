# ExpressJS Forms Example

In 2009, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) was created to facilitate using JavaScript on the server side (a.k.a. "Backend").  NodeJS is particularly useful for the extensive 3rd-party packaging ecosystem that supports it via the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).  This is similar to .NET and [nuget](https://www.nuget.org/), Python and the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/), Ruby and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/), PHP and [PEAR](https://pear.php.net/), and Go and [Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/).

[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) is a Framework for serving HTTP requests and web pages.

The MDN has a [good tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction).
